üè•Patient Management System (Technical):
- The patient management system is built on a modern microservices architecture, focusing on flexibility, scalability, and performance.

üöÄ Project Overview:
- This project is a comprehensive patient management system, designed with independent components (microservices) to ensure easy development, deployment, and maintenance. The system supports patient information management, secure authentication, and event-driven communication.

‚ú® Key Technologies:
- Spring Boot: Microservices development platform.
- gRPC & REST: Efficient communication protocols between services.
- PostgreSQL: Powerful relational database.
- Docker: Application packaging for consistent deployment.
- Kafka: Stream processing and event-driven communication.
- JUnit: Ensure code quality through unit testing.
- Swagger: Document and test APIs.
- AWS (ECS, RDS, MSK): Cloud platform for deployment (expected).

üí° Architecture (Overview):

The system is designed with a microservices architecture, including services such as:
- Auth Service: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- Patient Service: Processes patient information and data.
- Billing Service: Handles billing-related tasks.
- API Gateway: Single entry point for all client-side requests.
- Analytics Service: Analyzes patient data from Kafka.
- Communication is done via both gRPC (for high performance) and REST, with Kafka serving as the hub for asynchronous communication and event processing.
