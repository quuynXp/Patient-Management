Awesome! Here is a simple and clean README for the "Patient Management System" project, designed to be easy to read and understand.

üè• Patient Management System (Technical)
The patient management system is built on a modern microservices architecture, focusing on flexibility, scalability, and performance.

üöÄ Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive patient management system, designed with independent components (microservices) to ensure easy development, deployment, and maintenance. The system supports patient information management, secure authentication, and event-driven communication.

‚ú® Key Technologies
Spring Boot: Microservices development platform.
gRPC & REST: Efficient communication protocols between services.
PostgreSQL: Powerful relational database.
Docker: Application packaging for consistent deployment.
Kafka: Stream processing and event-driven communication.
JUnit: Ensure code quality through unit testing.
Swagger: Document and test APIs.
AWS (ECS, RDS, MSK): Cloud platform for deployment (expected).
üí° Architecture (Overview)
The system is designed with a microservices architecture, including services such as:

Auth Service: Manages user authentication and authorization.
Patient Service: Processes patient information and data.
Billing Service: Handles billing-related tasks.
API Gateway: Single entry point for all client-side requests.
Analytics Service: Analyzes patient data from Kafka.
Communication is done via both gRPC (for high performance) and REST, with Kafka serving as the hub for asynchronous communication and event processing.

‚öôÔ∏è Project Status
Currently, the project is in the development and architectural design phase. The components are clearly defined, but not yet deployed to the actual AWS environment.
